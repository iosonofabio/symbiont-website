                  <p>
                    As Isaac Newton wrote to Robert Hooke in 1675: “if I have seen further, it is by standing on the
                    shoulders of giants.” The Symbiont Awards seek to honor modern giants. Traditionally, data sharing
                    was challenging and expensive, so research proceeded by sharing completed findings. Our culture in
                    science and medicine has been built on the value of completed stories.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, with the rise of networked computers, sharing complex datasets is increasingly feasible.
                    Once data are shared, anyone can make discoveries from these data. This is good, at least in the
                    short term, for research. Discoveries arrive sooner, and patients benefit more quickly. Discoveries
                    are also more likely to emerge when they are still meaningful, before new discoveries have
                    rendered them less useful. But to avoid harm in the long term, we need to make sure that incentives
                    are aligned to guarantee that generating novel and interesting datasets remains rewarded.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We envision a future in which widespread sharing of research data benefits all. We expect the
                    biggest winners will be those who share and share well, and in doing so, create the most value.
                    However, until that time comes, the Symbiont Awards seek to recognize these individuals and their
                    contributions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis">Symbiosis</a> denotes a long-term interaction
                    between two different species. The interaction may be beneficial to both or may impose a cost on
                    a member of the interaction. Data sharing may impose a cost on the individual sharing, or it may
                    provide benefits.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Symbiont Awards, given annually, recognize exemplars in the practice of data sharing. We expect data sharing to play a key role in the scientific ecosystem. Some of the goals supported by data sharing include:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Facilitate meta-analysis and other granular, between-study analyses, even if the investigators who currently curate the data deem the project too far outside their interests* to justify a sharing effort.</li>
                        <li>Facilitate validation of emerging non-randomized analytical approaches (e.g., propensity score matching) via comparison to bona fide randomized data.</li>
                        <li>Facilitate independent attempts to address existing hypotheses using existing data, which can reveal previously unknown sensitivity of prior analyses to methodological assumptions ("pressure-testing" of the robustness of hypotheses; sensitivity analysis)</li>
                        <li>Facilitate the generation of novel hypotheses, leading researchers to perform new studies and generate new datasets.</li>
                        <li>Unburden research teams from having to handle every incoming request for data.</li>
                        <li>Broaden the impact of existing data, which are often generated at great time and expense.</li>
                        <li>Facilitate the emergence of important research findings faster than any one team can act to produce the results either alone or in collaboration.</li>
                    </ol>
                    *fundamentally in the sense of “what they enjoy thinking about”, but also, rarely, in the financial sense. The question that seems esoteric to the original study team might be highly pertinent to health in another context.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Symbiont Awards currently consist of two awards: the first recognizes an outstanding contribution
                    from any research area at any level. The second seeks to recognize the sharing of data relevant to
                    health by an individual at the training stage of their career - ideally a trainee with clinical
                    responsibilities.

                      PSB conference co-chairs do not serve as nominator or
                      endorser for any nomination submitted for this award.

                      Members of this award committee do not serve as a
                      nominator for any nomination for this award. If you have
                      nominated a candidate, inform the committee chair
                      immediately so that one of two actions may be taken: (a)
                      the nomination will be set aside for the year, or (b) you
                      will step down from the committee for the year.

                    <li>
                      Members of this committee should not be directly involved
                      in nominations prior to their submittal. Members can
                      answer general questions about what a nomination should
                      include but may not pre-review or comment on draft
                      nominations.

                    <li>
                      Members must maintain confidentiality about the internal
                      discussions of the committee. Information about committee
                      deliberations should not be shared with anyone outside the
                      committee, nor should the winner be discussed until PSB
                      has issued a formal statement.

                    <li>
                      Members of this committee and the committee as a whole do
                      not provide feedback to unsuccessful candidates. If a
                      member is asked for feedback, this policy should be cited.

                    <li>
                      Members of this committee are not eligible to be nominated
                      for the award during their time on the committee.
                      Individuals in the research group of a committee member
                      are also not eligible to be nominated for the award during
                      that member’s time on the committee.

                    <li>
                      Members of this committee must self-identify any
                      relationships/affiliations that might be perceived as a
                      source of potential bias, and inform the committee chair
                      of the COIs before any candidates have been discussed.
                      Identify any candidates with whom you: have had close
                      personal or working relationships within the past 5 years
                      or the period covered by the award, whichever is longer;
                      anyone for whom you were thesis advisor/advisee; anyone
                      for whom you were a postdoctoral advisor/advisee; anyone
                      for whom you were a faculty mentor/mentee; or any other
                      case where your judgment could be affected. Also identify
                      any candidates from your current institution or one where
                      you worked within the past 5 years.

                  </ol>
                  <p>
                    In the event that a committee member has a relationship
                    described in rule 7 with one or more nominees, s/he should
                    disclose that relationship to the other committee members
                    and describe the nature of the relationship(s).  The other
                    committee members should then decide (without the conflicted
                    committee member) whether the conflict is adequately
                    mitigated by disclosure.  In the event that a majority of
                    the other committee members believes the conflict is not
                    adequately mitigated by disclosure, the following procedure
                    should be followed: (1) The conflicted committee member may
                    not participate in the discussion of the conflicted nominee;
                    (2) If the non-conflicted committee members feel a
                    conflicted nominee should be an awardee, then those
                    committee members should send a written description of the
                    conflict and the rationale for their decision to the PSB
                    co-chairs; (3) if a majority of the PSB co-chairs believe
                    the decision has been improperly biased by the conflict, the
                    conflicted nominee cannot be the award winner, and the
                    committee will be tasked with selecting a different awardee.
